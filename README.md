# Battle-BG [FR]
This is a small project for making the task of inserting battle backgrounds for FR hackers easier than ever before.

Instructions:
1) Drop a vanilla FR rom called "BPRE0.gba" in a newly created folder called roms.
2) Run make from your console.
3) A rom called multi.gba should have generated in a folder called build; That's your rom with Battle-BGs inserted!
